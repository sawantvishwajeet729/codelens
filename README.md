CodeLens is an AI-powered web application that extracts all non-binary files from a GitHub repository, combines them into a single text document, and converts the content into a vector database using OpenAI embeddings and FAISS. Users can then query the repositoryâ€™s knowledge using a powerful LLM, enabling instant insights and answers.
